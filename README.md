[dFTR - Unity!](https://asgith.github.io/unity-dFTR-page) is a project, which is very similar to the Game Boy project of the same name (Game Boy - dFTR). The idea of this project is to transform it. Transform it from a 2D game, into a 3D one. Plus, adding more ideas that wouldn't be able to be used on the Game Boy given the limitations of the hardware. My goal for this project, complete the race while diffrent events occur, to change the dynamics of the race.

Latest Update:

* April 14th, 2021
  - Decided to change the player and track models to a voxel based model instead.
  - Player controller was changed to accommodate the new voxel model.
